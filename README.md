## Why Harold Finch?
>The project began with another title and programming language until I read [this](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/03/28/realistic-developer-fiction/) article.  It took me a day to finally just "pick" a character when I realized H.F. Quiz Machine simply had a nice ring to it even if root was my favorite from that particular series.
